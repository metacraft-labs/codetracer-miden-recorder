//! The trace states every source file's line count (`meta.dat` bit 14,
//! `FLAG_HAS_LINE_COUNT_TABLE`), and the writer the recorder configures
//! refuses a step past a file's last line.
//!
//! Without the table a reader lays every file out at the writer's
//! 100 000-lines-per-file convention, which the container does not record.
//! With it, each `paths.dat` record carries the file's real size, and a step
//! one line past the end — whose address would fall inside the NEXT file's
//! range and read back as a location that was never recorded — is refused at
//! the only place that can see it: the writer.
//!
//! No mocks: the recorder runs on real MASM fixtures, the container it writes
//! is read back through the pure-Rust `codetracer_trace_reader`, and the
//! refusal is observed on the production Nim writer.
