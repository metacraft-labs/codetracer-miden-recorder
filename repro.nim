## Reprobuild dev env + build recipe for codetracer-miden-recorder.
##
## Mirrors the dev shell declared in ``flake.nix`` (Linux/macOS) and
## the Windows DIY env declared in ``env.ps1``. ``repro build`` /
## ``repro test`` reproduce the same artefacts and the same test set
## that ``just build`` / ``just test`` produce today.
##
## Per ``codetracer-specs/Repo-Requirements.md`` §2.8 the recipe
## expresses build and test execution NATIVELY through typed-tool
## edges (`cargo.build`, `cargo.test`). It does NOT delegate to
## `shell(command = "bash scripts/...")` wrappers for the Rust build /
## test — delegation defeats the engine's incremental-build,
## action-cache, per-test invalidation, and the CI sharding the engine
## grows into per ``reprobuild-specs/CI-Sharding.md``. The ONE
## ``sh.shell`` edge below wraps the repo's CLI-convention verification
## script, which is not a cargo target — it is a POSIX-shell assertion
## harness that ``just test`` runs after ``cargo test`` (see ``Justfile``
## ``test:``), so it is modelled as its own execute edge rather than
## dropped.
##
## On Windows the recipe drives real reprobuild tool provisioning via
## the tarball entries the ``uses:`` packages declare (cargo, rustc,
## nim, nimble, capnp). On Linux/macOS the Nix flake continues to
## supply the same toolchain. Either path produces byte-equivalent
## build outputs and the same test pass/fail set — CI cross-checks this
## through the side-by-side `ci.yml` (nix) + `ci-reprobuild.yml`
## (reprobuild) flow per Repo-Requirements §2.9.
##
## **This repo is a Rust CONSUMER of two sibling crates, but NOT a
## reprobuild ``uses: "<sibling>"`` consumer.** The recorder's
## ``Cargo.toml`` pulls in two crates from the sibling
## ``codetracer-trace-format`` repo via cargo ``path`` dependencies:
## ``codetracer_trace_types`` (``path =
## "../codetracer-trace-format/codetracer_trace_types"``) and
## ``codetracer_trace_writer_nim`` (``path =
## "../codetracer-trace-format/codetracer_trace_writer_nim"``). Both are
## resolved and compiled INSIDE cargo — out of reprobuild's reach — so
## they are NOT reprobuild library-threaded ``uses:`` consumptions
## (``codetracer-trace-format`` is a Rust workspace, not a Nim-library
## sibling in the AVAILABLE set). This matches how the sibling
## recorders (leo, circom, evm, cairo, …) model the identical
## dependency: the toolchain floor for the Nim FFI that
## ``codetracer_trace_writer_nim``'s ``build.rs`` compiles at cargo
## build time (``nim`` + ``nimble`` + ``capnp`` + ``zstd``) is declared
## in ``uses:``, and cargo does the cross-crate wiring itself. The lock
## is therefore self-only — no sibling ``deps`` entries.
##
## **Per-test platform gating.** ``just test`` is ``cargo test
## --locked`` followed by the CLI-convention shell script — no test
## FILE in this repo carries a per-host gate. The ``tests/*.rs`` suites
## record the pre-compiled ``.masm`` fixtures under
## ``test-programs/masm`` (and the mockchain / client-replay fixtures)
## and assert on the produced ``.ct`` container (piped through
## ``ct-print`` where content assertions are made) on every host cargo
## supports, so the single whole-workspace ``cargo.test`` execute edge
## below matches the repo's own ``just test`` one-for-one — there is no
## per-OS partition to model. The shell verify edge is POSIX-portable
## (``bash``) and is likewise unconditional.
##
## **Tool provisioning.** ``defaultToolProvisioning "path"`` matches the
## canonical Rust-recorder recipes: the nix dev shell puts ``cargo`` /
## ``rustc`` / ``nim`` / ``nimble`` / ``capnp`` / ``zstd`` /
## ``miden`` on ``PATH`` (and ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` for libzstd +
## openssl), so the weak-local PATH resolver is the right default.
## Without it ``repro build`` refuses to run with "typed tool
## provisioning is required for uses declarations".
##
## Miden: test corpus is pre-compiled MASM artefacts under
## ``test-programs/masm``; the recorder records them directly through
## the bundled Miden VM crate, no external Miden assembler is needed.
